# Video Explainer Script for GitHub Stargazers Viewer

## Introduction
- Welcome to the GitHub Stargazers Viewer project!
- This application allows users to explore the stargazers of any GitHub repository, providing insights into who is interested in a project.

## Development Stack
- The project is built using the following technologies:
  - **Frontend**: Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework that allows for building reactive user interfaces with a simple and intuitive syntax.
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express, which provides a robust server-side framework for handling API requests and responses.
  - **Caching**: Redis, used for caching API responses to improve performance and reduce the number of requests made to the GitHub API.
  - **HTTP Requests**: Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the GitHub API.

## Current Features
- **View Stargazers**: Users can view a list of stargazers for any specified GitHub repository.
- **Caching**: The application caches API responses using Redis, which speeds up data retrieval and reduces load on the GitHub API.
- **Pagination**: Users can navigate through stargazer results with pagination, making it easier to browse large datasets.
- **Filters**: The application includes filters for location and email availability, allowing users to refine their search results.

## Opportunities for Improvements
- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication would allow users to save their favorite repositories and access personalized features.
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Adding more filters, such as by date of stargazing, could provide users with more granular control over their searches.
- **Error Handling**: Improving error handling and user feedback for API failures would enhance the user experience.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Further improving the user interface and user experience with better styling and animations could make the application more engaging.
- **Testing**: Implementing unit and integration tests would ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

## Conclusion
